I'm a Visiting Student Researcher at [Sky Computing Lab](https://sky.cs.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley, advised by Prof. [Ion Stoica](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~istoica/). I received my B.S. in Computer Science from [Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn/). My Chinese name is 李知非.

My research interests lie in building efficient system support for AI applications, focusing on cloud resource orchestration and storage optimization.
