I'm a Visiting Student Researcher at UC Berkeley's [Sky Computing Lab](https://sky.cs.berkeley.edu/), working with Prof. [Ion Stoica](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~istoica/). I'm also a senior-year CS undergraduate at [Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn/) in the Turing Honors Class.

My research interests lie in building efficient systems for machine learning workloads, focusing on cloud resource orchestration and storage-optimized serving.
