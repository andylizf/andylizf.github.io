Hi! I’m Zhifei (Andy) Li. I’m a Visiting Student Researcher at UC Berkeley’s Sky Computing Lab and a senior-year CS undergraduate at Renmin University of China.

My passion lies at the intersection of AI Systems, Cloud Computing, and Operating Systems. I enjoy building practical, efficient, and scalable infrastructure for AI workloads—tools that simplify research and production.

I am preparing to pursue a PhD in Computer Science. If you’d like to chat or are recruiting for research/PhD opportunities, feel free to reach out.
