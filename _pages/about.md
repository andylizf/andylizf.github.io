Hi! I’m Zhifei (Andy) Li. I’m interested in building and optimizing machine learning infrastructure and cloud computing systems.

Currently, I’m an undergraduate at Renmin University of China, and an exchange student at UC Berkeley. I like designing efficient AI platforms, distributed systems, and tooling that make research and production workflows simpler.

If you’re recruiting for research roles or PhD programs, feel free to reach out.
