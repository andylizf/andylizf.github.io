I'm a Visiting Student Researcher at UC Berkeley's [Sky Computing Lab](https://sky.cs.berkeley.edu/), working with [Prof. Ion Stoica](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~istoica/). I'm also a senior-year CS undergraduate at [Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn/) (Turing Honors Class, Rank: 5/136).

## Research Interests

My research focuses on designing efficient systems for machine learning workloads, with particular interests in cloud resource orchestration, distributed training infrastructure, and storage-optimized serving. I am particularly interested in cross-layer optimizations and exploring how AI techniques can advance systems design methodologies.

## Current Projects

- **[SkyNomad](https://github.com/skypilot-org/skypilot)**: Multi-region spot instance scheduling for deadline-sensitive ML workloads, achieving 50% cost reduction over state-of-the-art baselines
- **[LEANN](https://github.com/yichuan-w/LEANN)**: Storage-efficient vector index for compound AI systems, achieving 97% storage reduction while maintaining <5% latency impact (4,000+ GitHub stars)
- **AI-driven systems research**: Exploring automated optimization through evolutionary algorithms and LLM-guided design space exploration
